title: Why "Meanwhile"
---
Behind the name 'Meanwhile' is the commitment to live with God. Our lives are wrapped up in a bigger, unfolding story that Jesus has revealled. Life today is complicated and confusing. Its easy to get side-tracked into living a story that revolves too much around our own needs and wants. Too often stories of defficit, woundedness, anxiety and inadeqacy get the better of us in the wrestle to stay emotional and spiritual healthy.

              Healthy christian practices bring us back to the bigger story. They challenge our missconceptions when our story is too small and help us remeber God's presence. When we meet we break bread together, when we pray, when we study the bible, we remember. Our problems are reframed. We can be more prayerful, more thankful and more hopeful even when life is difficult.

              The bigger story is essential because life is only ever truely lived when its done with its maker. Augustine said our hearts are restless until they are found in God. Our story is incomplete until we know its place in God's story. We were made to live in harmony with God, forgiven by God and partners with God in life. It's deeply good.
